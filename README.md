# hello-world
this project is for learning and testing


Two things. One, I have no idea why this planet is called 26 North. It’s not the 26th of anything, and what does North mean in space anyway? Two, I never expected to live this long.
Not that I’m old in any absolute sense. People like me, because of the job we do, just don’t live that long.
